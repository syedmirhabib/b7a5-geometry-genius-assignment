        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The purpose of DOM is to provide a way for programs to interact with the page by modifying its content and structure.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">There are several ways to select HTML elements using DOM. Here are some common DOM methods:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><code>document.getElementById()</code> - selects an element with the specified ID.</li>
                <li><code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> - selects elements with the specified class name.</li>
                <li><code>document.getElementsByTagName()</code> - selects elements with the specified tag name.</li>
                <li><code>document.querySelector()</code> - selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.</li>
                <li><code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> - selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">3. What is event bubble?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM, where the event starts from the most specific element and flows outwards to the least specific element. For example, if a button inside a div is clicked, the button click event is triggered first, and then the div click event is triggered.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function when it has completed its task. The purpose of a callback function is to allow the calling function to perform some additional task after the completion of the called function. In other words, a callback function is used to execute a function after another function has finished executing.
                
                Callback functions are commonly used in JavaScript to perform asynchronous operations such as reading files, making HTTP requests, and executing animations. Since these operations take some time to complete, the calling function does not wait for their completion and instead provides a callback function to be executed when the operation has finished. This way, the calling function can continue with its remaining tasks while the asynchronous operation is being performed in the background.</p>
